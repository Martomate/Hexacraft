## Features:

## Installation

The game requires Java 8 (or later) to be installed. If it's not installed you can get it [here](https://java.com).

### Using the Hexacraft Launcher (easiest)

You can download the launcher [here](https://github.com/Martomate/Hexacraft/releases/tag/launcher-1.1).

### Version 0.8
In this version you can run the game in any of the following ways.
- Run `bin/hexacraft.bat` (Windows)
- Run `bin/hexacraft` (Mac/Linux)
- Double click `lib/com.martomate.hexacraft-0.8-launcher.jar` (like in the previous version)

### Version 0.7 and earlier
Up to version 0.7 the game was shipped as a couple of folders and a jar file.
To get started, just run `Hexacraft.jar` (or Hexagon.jar in early versions) either by **double-clicking** it or using the terminal.
In the terminal you would run `java -jar Hexacraft.jar`

Almost three years later the game moved to GitHub and since then anyone has had the chance to contribute. More information about how to contribute is available [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
