### Worlds are saved
The program works very similarly to Minecraft (at least when it comes to saving worlds).

You can create as many worlds as you like and they will be saved on your computer. To find the files go to the folder named ".hexacraft" in the %appdata% directory on Windows and in the home directory on Mac and Linux (just like for Minecraft).
